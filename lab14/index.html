                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>For this lab we had to look back at our old work and debug anything that needed it.</p>
               
                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>The biggest thing I ran into was in the earlier JS labs I would have the JS linked in both the head and body of my HTML, which would read as an error in the console. Other than that I took this as an opportunity to refactor some old code and fix minor issues.</p>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>A bug free website!</p>
