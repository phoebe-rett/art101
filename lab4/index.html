			<h1>Lab 4- Psuedocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we had to practice psuedocoding with both everyday tasks and simple computer games. We also had to practice commenting in js and using both html and css.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was for the most part pretty straightforward, I think the biggest problem I experienced was doubting if the language I was using for the psuedocode was correct. I think as I gain more familiarity with psuedocoding, the conventions will become more obvious.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Task 1:</p>
					<p>Lighting a candle:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Find a candle and a matchbook</li>
						<li>Light the match
						<ul>
							<li>Take the match out</li>
							<li>Press the match head on the striker</li>
							<li>Quickly swipe the match head against the striker</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Light the candle
						<ul>
							<li>Hold the head of the match against the candle wick</li>
							<li>Once the wick is lit, pull the match away</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Blow out the match</li>
					</ul>
					<img id="peg-solitaire" src="img/peg-solitaire.jpeg"/>
					<p>Task 2:</p>
					<p>Peg Solitaire:</p>
					</p><pre><code>
						//Print board before each turn
 							 //print a row of 1
  								//print a row of 2
  								//and so on, until 5
  								//each row, but row 1, has a pin
						//Accept user input
  							 //selected pin, jumps to selected empty space
 							 //must have an existing pin to jump over
						//Validate user move
 							 //jumped pin is removed
						//Test for win! Condition
  							 //all but one pin has been removed
					</code></pre>
