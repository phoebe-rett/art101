                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>For this lab we had to create a funciton that used a loop and conditionals so that every number divisable by 3, 5, and/or 7 has an output of "Fizz", "Buzz", and/or "Boom" respectively.</p>
               
                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I think referencing the Yuja really helped this time, though I also used ChatGPT when I was struggling to get the output to work. It would up being that I didn't have CSS set for the output div and the font was the same color as the background! That was easy enough to fix though getting the output to be somewhat clear still took some experimenting.</p>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>Look below:</p>

                <div class="minor-section" id="output"> 
                    <h2>FIZZ BUZZ BOOM!</h2>
                    <p></p>
                </div>
