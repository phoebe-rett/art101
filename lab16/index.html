                    <p>Make sure CORS unblock browser extension is enabled!!!</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>For this lab we had to be able to use .ajax to get the data from an api and output the results in out html. The bonus task required us to use buttons to pull up previous comics from the api.</p>
               
                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I sturggled initially to get the image to output but later realized I had forgotten a pair of quotation marks. I also had trouble with task X but Leilah helped me figure out the functions and variable names I needed to get the yesterday and last week buttons to work.</p>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>View below and see the comic from yesterday or last week!</p>
                </div>
