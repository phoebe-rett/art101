                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>For this lab we had to write a js function that accepts user input, sorts it, and returns it.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>This lab defintely requires a lot of attention to detail. I ran into an issue where the website window prompt would work but nothing else did, it wound up just being an extra space and once it was delted everything worked. Other than that I had a lot of fun experimenting with what the function could do. </p>
